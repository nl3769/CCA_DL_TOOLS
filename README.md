# Overview

The following REPO provides codes for the following topics:
* SIMULATION
* caroDeepSeg
* caroDeepMotion
* speckleTracking
* textureImprovment

# SIMULATION
All this code run in *matlab* and *cuda*. For one simulation, the process is as follow:
1. make phantom
2. simulation
3. beamforming

The whole process can be performed locally, but the simulation step is very time consuming. Therefore, the phantom and simulation are performed on the CREATIS cluster and the beamforming can be performed locally, provided you have a GPU on your computer.

## run the code locally
The functions to run are in **SIMULATION/run_local**. It contains several functions:
* run_mk_phantom.m
* run_simulation.m
* run_beamforming.m

### run_mk_phantom.m
This function takes as input the path to the database (path to the images), the path to save the phantom, the path to the simulation parameter (.json file) and some additional information (extra_info) to write in the name of the saved file.

The output of this function is structured as follow:
* path_res/img_name/img_name_id_001_extra_info/bmode_result
* path_res/img_name/img_name_id_001_extra_info/parameters
* path_res/img_name/img_name_id_001_extra_info/phantom
* path_res/img_name/img_name_id_001_extra_info/raw_data
