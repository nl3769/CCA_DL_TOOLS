# Overview

The following REPO provides codes for the following topics:
* SIMULATION
* caroDeepSeg
* caroDeepMotion
* speckleTracking
* textureImprovment

# SIMULATION
All this code run in matlab and cuda. For one simulation, the process is as follow:
1. make phantom
2. simulation
3. beamforming

The full process can be run locally, but the simulation step is very long, thus phantom and simulation are done on the cluster of CREATIS and the beamforming can be done locally, provided that you have a GPU on your computer.
