# Overview

The following REPO provides codes for the following topics:
* SIMULATION
* caroDeepSeg
* caroDeepMotion
* speckleTracking
* textureImprovment

# SIMULATION
All this code run in matlab and cuda. For one simulation, the process is as follow:
1. make phantom
2. simulation
3. beamforming

The whole process can be performed locally, but the simulation step is very time consuming. Therefore, the phantom and simulation are performed on the CREATIS cluster and the beamforming can be performed locally, provided you have a GPU on your computer.
